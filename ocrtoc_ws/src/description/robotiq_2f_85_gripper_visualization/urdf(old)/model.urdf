	Coordinate system convention for grippers:
	The pin of the gripper is along the y-axis, and z-axis points up.
	The resulting x-axis is considered the palm face, so +y is right, and -y is left for
	a right-hand gripper, whatever that means in this gripper.

	Coarse and precise models:

	Two granularities for collision are provided, a coarse (default) for quick motion
	planning purposes, and a precise for grasp simulation. This is selected with the
	boolean parameter precise_collision = true/false (default to false)

	In the same line, there is the adaptive_transmission parameter that might use
	pure mimic joints (default and motion does not consider adaptation) for visualization
	and update of real hw, and an implementation of the 5-bar transmission with
	spring transmission for grasp simulation.

	For grasp simulation, the file 2f85.gazebo.xacro sets additional parameters such as
	material properties, and simulation parameters.
